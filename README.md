# Sky's Oxygen Not Included mods

The source code for my Oxygen Not Included mods.

Many thanks to Peter Han and Cairath for their help and also for graciously letting me reference their code. I wouldn't have been able to mod ONI without their help. In particular, the build system used in this solution was originally written by Cairath.

### Radiator

Adds a new building to the Utilities tab called the Radiator, built with 400kg of Refined Metal. It is passively warmed up by liquid piped through it, and when it is in space (no backwall!), it passively cools itself by radiating its heat to space. It radiates more heat the hotter it is. Unlike the thermo-tuners, it does not take power but also does not actively pump heat. The Radiator does not overheat or be entombed, but it is damageable by meteorites. The Radiator also does not need access to the sun. It is unlocked through the research Temperature Modulation.

Aside from radiating heat into space, the Radiator can also be used as a more compact version of a typical radiant pipe loop. Simply plop a few in the fluid of your choice and route liquid through it!
